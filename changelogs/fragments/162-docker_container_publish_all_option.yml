minor_changes:
  - docker_container - added ``publish_all_ports`` option to publish all exposed ports to random ports except those
    explicitly bound with ``published_ports`` (this was already added in community.docker 1.8.0)
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/162).
